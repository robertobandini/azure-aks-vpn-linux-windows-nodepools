# azure-aks-vpn-linux-windows-nodepools
Example of creating an AKS with Terraform with private VPN access and Linux/Windows node pools.  

The goal of this sample project is to create an infrastructure that not only allows you to create an AKS, a Kubernetes managed on the Azure cloud provider, but also to access it completely privately, creating everything necessary for this via a dedicated P2S VPN.

Furthermore, the AKS will be able to use not only a system node pool, but also a node pool of Linux machines and another of Windows machines.
